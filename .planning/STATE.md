## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v5.0]: Three-agent system: Mad Genius (attacker), Skeptic (validator), Taskmaster (coverage enforcer)
- [v5.0]: 16 audit units covering all 29 contracts with mandatory call-tree expansion and storage-write mapping
- [v5.0]: All agents run Opus (quality profile) -- no model downgrades at any stage
- [v5.0]: Arithmetic and reentrancy excluded -- already covered exhaustively in v3.0-v4.4
- [v5.0]: Design doc at .planning/ULTIMATE-AUDIT-DESIGN.md
- [Phase 103]: Category C restricted to state-changing internal helpers; view/pure in D. Storage comparison uses AST-ID-normalized types.
- [Phase 103]: Mad Genius: 0 VULNERABLE, 7 INVESTIGATE findings across 49 functions. BAF-class cache check SAFE on all 19 direct functions.
- [Phase 124]: Direct calls (no try/catch) for charity hooks -- reverts are bugs to surface
- [Phase 124]: resolveLevel(lvl-1) passes the COMPLETED level since game pre-increments to purchaseLevel

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ContractAddresses.sol has unstaged changes (different deploy addresses) -- stash before test runs

# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-17)

**Core value:** Every finding a C4A warden could submit is identified and either fixed or documented as known before the audit begins.
**Current focus:** v29.0 Post-v27 Contract Delta Audit — defining requirements for a full adversarial audit of the 8 contract-touching commits since v27.0 (2026-04-13).

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Milestone: v29.0 — Post-v27 Contract Delta Audit
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-04-17 — Milestone v29.0 started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v28.0]: Audit target is sibling `database/` repo — planning artifacts remain in `degenerus-audit/.planning/`
- [v28.0]: Three intent sources graded against: API.md prose, openapi.yaml spec, in-source comments
- [v28.0]: Four mismatch directions in scope — docs→code, code→docs, comment→code, schema↔migration
- [v28.0]: Three audit scopes in this milestone — API handlers, DB schema + migrations, indexer
- [v28.0]: Deliverable is `audit/FINDINGS-v28.0.md` in v27.0 consolidated-findings style
- [v28.0 roadmap]: API group split into two phases (224 route↔spec surface, 225 handler bodies + validation schemas) because the 5 API requirements cover meaningfully different audit surfaces
- [v28.0 roadmap]: IDX group split into two phases (227 event-processor correctness, 228 cursor/reorg/view-refresh state machines) because event routing and state-machine semantics are different skillsets of audit work
- [v28.0 roadmap]: SCHEMA group kept as one phase (226) covering all 4 SCHEMA requirements — surface is tractable and migration reconciliation naturally chains into comment/orphan checks
- [v28.0 roadmap]: FIND phase (229) last, depends on all upstream phases
- [v27.0]: Scope bounded to call-site integrity — storage layout (done v25.0), deployed bytecode (requires RPC infra), and revert specificity (debuggability) are explicitly out of scope
- [v27.0]: `is IDegenerusGame` compile-time inheritance not adopted — high mechanical cost (~57 `override` additions) against existing `check-interfaces` Makefile gate that catches the same class; reconsider only if the gate ever produces false negatives
- [Phase 220]: check-delegatecall gate operates on source text (no forge build prereq). Runs under 1s vs check-interfaces ~10s.
- [Phase 220]: CONTRACTS_DIR env var pattern established for future gates — scripts must support overriding target tree so negative tests run in /tmp without touching contracts/.
- [Phase 221]: Raw selector gate mirrors Phase 220 architecture (bash+awk, CONTRACTS_DIR override, PASS/FAIL stdout).
- [Phase 222]: 76 leverage-first integration tests in CoverageGap222.t.sol close 177 CRITICAL_GAPs via natural caller chains.
- [Phase 223]: v27.0 Call-Site Integrity Audit SHIPPED 2026-04-13 — all 14/14 CSI-NN requirements Complete, 16 INFO findings consolidated, 3 new KNOWN-ISSUES entries.
- [Phase 224]: API-01 + API-02 verified via 27/27/27 triple-alignment catalog (openapi.yaml, 8 route files, API.md) — zero functional drift; path-normalization rule `{name}` ≡ `:name` locked for Phase 225 to reuse; no gate shipped per D-224-01 (catalog-only).
- [Phase 225 Plan 01]: API-03 HTTP handler comment audit complete — 27/27 handlers audited in `database/src/api/routes/*.ts`; D-225-04 Tier A/B threshold applied; 4 F-28-225-NN finding stubs (01 Tier A on game.ts earliest-day `<> 'dgnrs'` predicate vs "any distributions" comment; 02-03 Tier B on game.ts roll1/roll2 undocumented 404 branches; 04 Tier B on replay.ts day/:day JSDoc omitting the winning-trait + same-tx filter). All INFO, direction comment->code, default resolution RESOLVED-DOC per D-225-02. Tier C count 19/27 (handlers without JSDoc) recorded as context only. D-225-01 scope exclusion respected: no file in `src/handlers/*.ts` was audited.
- [Phase 225]: Response-shape audit: 8 sampled + 19 expanded = 27/27 coverage; 9 F-28-225-NN stubs (5 INFO + 4 LOW); 58 occurrences of z.number() vs integer consolidated as F-28-225-05; 3 endpoints fully PASS on expansion using z.number().int() pattern
- [Phase 226]: 226-03: SCHEMA-02 zero-finding outcome (all 27 column-claims correct); F-28-226-201..299 block unused
- [Phase 226]: Plan 226-02 consumed F-28-226-01 (pre-assigned) plus F-28-226-09 (meta-chain break 0002->0003) and F-28-226-10 (quest_definitions.difficulty TS-vs-SQL drift); next available ID for Plan 226-03 is F-28-226-11.
- [Phase 227]: D-227-09 verdict depth verified across 95 events; 6 LOW silent-truncation findings emitted (F-28-227-101..106)

### Pending Todos

- Phase transition fix (uncommitted): AdvanceModule line 428 `_unlockRng(day)` removed so jackpot→purchase housekeeping packs into the last jackpot physical day. CompressedJackpot test day-counts updated; two new turbo tests added; WhaleBundle `issueWhaleBoonForRecipient` helper fixed. Changes live on main but are not part of any milestone — consider folding into v28.0 scope or a parallel v27.1.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Cross-repo audit: primary artifacts in `degenerus-audit/.planning/` but audit target code is at `/home/zak/Dev/PurgeGame/database/`. Workflow must handle both paths — phase plans should resolve paths against the database/ root, not this repo's contracts/ tree.
- Indexer correctness (Phase 227) has a shared surface with this repo's contracts — cross-references from `database/src/indexer/event-processor.ts` into `contracts/*.sol` events will be needed.
- Migration reconciliation (Phase 226) requires reading all 7 `database/drizzle/*.sql` migrations as a cumulative diff — ordering matters; each migration must be interpreted as a delta from its predecessor.

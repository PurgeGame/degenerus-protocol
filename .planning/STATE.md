# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-11)

**Core value:** Players can purchase tickets at any time — no downtime during RNG processing or jackpot payouts
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Storage Foundation

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-work]: Bit-23 key encoding for double buffer — avoids new mapping declarations, zero storage layout change
- [Pre-work]: uint128 packing for prize pools — saves 1 SSTORE per purchase
- [Pre-work]: Freeze only at daily RNG, not mid-day — mid-day processing doesn't touch jackpots/payouts
- [Phase 01]: prizePoolPendingPacked at Slot 16 (in-place replacement) to avoid storage slot shifts
- [Phase 01]: error E() centralized in DegenerusGameStorage -- Solidity 0.8.34 forbids redeclaration in inheritance chain

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Run `forge inspect DegenerusGameStorage storage-layout` before and after Slot 1 changes to catch any byte-offset shift — stale module artifacts are a silent correctness hazard
- [Phase 4]: Map every break path through `do { } while(false)` in advanceGame to its freeze-state expectation before writing code; missing an unfreeze site leaves freeze permanently active
- [Phase 4]: Confirm whether `ticketCursor` reset is explicitly handled in the swap function or drain loop re-entry path (gap identified in research)

# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-25)

**Core value:** Every finding a C4A warden could submit is identified and either fixed or documented as known before the audit begins.
**Current focus:** Phase 103 — game-router-storage-layout

## Current Position

Phase: 103 (game-router-storage-layout) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 4

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v5.0]: Three-agent system: Mad Genius (attacker), Skeptic (validator), Taskmaster (coverage enforcer)
- [v5.0]: 16 audit units covering all 29 contracts with mandatory call-tree expansion and storage-write mapping
- [v5.0]: All agents run Opus (quality profile) -- no model downgrades at any stage
- [v5.0]: Arithmetic and reentrancy excluded -- already covered exhaustively in v3.0-v4.4
- [v5.0]: Design doc at .planning/ULTIMATE-AUDIT-DESIGN.md
- [Phase 103]: Category C restricted to state-changing internal helpers; view/pure in D. Storage comparison uses AST-ID-normalized types.
- [Phase 103]: Mad Genius: 0 VULNERABLE, 7 INVESTIGATE findings across 49 functions. BAF-class cache check SAFE on all 19 direct functions.
- [Phase 125]: Pre-existing 14 Foundry + 32 Hardhat failures from Phases 121-124 documented as baseline, not caused by pruning
- [Phase 125]: Function-level coverage tracing proves zero unique coverage lost across all 13 deleted test files

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ContractAddresses.sol has unstaged changes (different deploy addresses) -- stash before test runs

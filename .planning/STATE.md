# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-18)

**Core value:** Every finding a C4A warden could submit is identified and either fixed or documented as known before the audit begins.
**Current focus:** Phase 237 — VRF Consumer Inventory & Call Graph

## Current Position

Phase: 237 (VRF Consumer Inventory & Call Graph) — EXECUTING (Wave 2 in progress)
Plan: 3 of 3 (Wave 2 — 237-02 complete 2026-04-19; 237-03 pending)
**Milestone:** v30.0 — Full Fresh-Eyes VRF Consumer Determinism Audit
**Phase:** 237 (VRF Consumer Inventory & Call Graph) — Wave 2 in progress (2/3 plans complete)
**Plan:** 237-01 complete (Wave 1 / INV-01 universe list); 237-02 complete (Wave 2 / INV-02 classification); 237-03 pending (Wave 2 / INV-03 call-graph + consolidation)
**Status:** Wave 2 of Phase 237 in progress; 237-03 ready to execute
**Last activity:** 2026-04-19

**Audit baseline:** HEAD `7ab515fe` (contract tree identical to v29.0 `1646d5af`; all post-v29 commits are docs-only)
**Write policy:** READ-only — no `contracts/` / `test/` edits (carry forward v28/v29 cross-repo READ-only pattern). Writes confined to `.planning/`, `audit/`, and possibly `KNOWN-ISSUES.md` (for FIND-03 promotions).
**Deliverable target:** `audit/FINDINGS-v30.0.md`

**Accepted RNG exceptions (out of scope for re-litigation — documented in KNOWN-ISSUES.md):**

1. Non-VRF entropy for affiliate winner roll (deterministic seed, gas optimization)
2. Gameover prevrandao fallback — `_getHistoricalRngFallback` after 14-day VRF outage
3. Gameover RNG substitution for mid-cycle write-buffer tickets (F-29-04 invariant disclosure)
4. EntropyLib XOR-shift PRNG — VRF-seeded, known theoretical non-uniformity

## Phase Structure (6 phases, 237-242)

| Phase | Name | Requirements | Depends On |
|-------|------|--------------|------------|
| 237 | VRF Consumer Inventory & Call Graph | INV-01, INV-02, INV-03 | — |
| 238 | Backward & Forward Freeze Proofs | BWD-01..03, FWD-01..03 | 237 |
| 239 | rngLocked Invariant & Permissionless Sweep | RNG-01, RNG-02, RNG-03 | 237 |
| 240 | Gameover Jackpot Safety | GO-01..05 | 237 |
| 241 | Exception Closure | EXC-01..04 | 237 |
| 242 | Regression + Findings Consolidation | REG-01, REG-02, FIND-01..03 | 238, 239, 240, 241 |

**Execution order:** 237 first. After 237 completes, 238/239/240/241 can execute in parallel. 242 requires all four.

## Accumulated Context

Decisions logged in `.planning/PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table.
Detailed milestone retrospective in `.planning/RETROSPECTIVE.md` "Milestone: v29.0".
Full v29.0 phase artifacts in `.planning/milestones/v29.0-phases/`.

Prior RNG-related milestone artifacts worth referencing during v30.0 planning (but NOT relied upon — this is fresh-eyes):

- v25.0 RNG fresh-eyes sweep (Phases 213-217)
- v29.0 Phase 235 Plans 03-04 (per-consumer backward-trace + commitment-window enumeration)
- v29.0 Phase 235 Plan 05 (TRNX-01 rngLocked invariant 4-path re-proof)
- v3.7 VRF Path Test Coverage (Phases 63-67 Foundry invariants + Halmos proofs)
- v3.8 VRF commitment window audit (Phases 68-72)

### Pending Todos

- Execute Plan 237-03 (Wave 2 / INV-03 per-consumer call-graphs + Consumer Index + final consolidation into `audit/v30-CONSUMER-INVENTORY.md`)
- After 237-03 emits final consolidated `audit/v30-CONSUMER-INVENTORY.md`, unblock Phases 238-241

### Phase 237 Plan 01 Decisions (2026-04-19)

- D-07 two-pass zero-glance + reconciliation methodology honoured: Task 1 fresh-eyes file committed standalone (`18f519b7`) BEFORE Task 2 began any prior-artifact read. Auditable ex-post via git log separation.
- 146 INV-237-NNN rows at HEAD `7ab515fe` (5.2× prior 235-03 baseline — expansion entirely driven by finer D-01/D-02/D-03/D-06 granularity, not by any post-v29 contract change).
- Reconciliation verdict distribution: 45 confirmed-fresh-matches-prior / 12 new-since-prior-audit / 0 was-missed-now-added / 0 was-spurious-before-not-at-HEAD.
- 5 finding candidates surfaced (all severity INFO), routed to Phase 242 per D-15.
- Zero F-30-NN IDs emitted per D-15. Zero `contracts/` or `test/` writes per D-18.

### Phase 237 Plan 02 Decisions (2026-04-19)

- Classification distribution at 146-row granularity: `daily` 91 / `mid-day-lootbox` 19 / `gap-backfill` 3 / `gameover-entropy` 7 / `other` 26 = 146. `daily` share (62.3%) exceeds the planner's 30-50% heuristic — not a classification error; driven by D-01 fine-grained expansion. Flagged in Finding Candidates as sanity-check observation.
- KI-exception rules (1 / 2 / 3 per decision procedure) take precedence over path-family rules (4 / 5 / 6 / 7). Consequence: `_gameOverEntropy` cluster splits across 3 family labels: 7 rows → `gameover-entropy`, 2 rows → `other / exception-mid-cycle-substitution`, 8 rows → `other / exception-prevrandao-fallback`. Effective gameover-flow scope (for Phase 240 GO-01) = 19 rows across those 3 labels.
- KI Cross-Ref distribution (D-06 proof-subject set for Phase 241 EXC-01..04): EXC-01 2 rows / EXC-02 8 rows / EXC-03 4 rows / EXC-04 8 rows = 22 proof targets. Phase 239 RNG-03 index-advance re-justification set = 13 rows.
- 7 Finding Candidates surfaced (all severity INFO), routed to Phase 242 per D-15. No F-30-NN IDs emitted. No edits to `audit/v30-237-01-UNIVERSE.md` (D-16 READ-only-after-commit honoured). Zero `contracts/` or `test/` writes per D-18.

### Blockers/Concerns

_(none — Waves 1 and 2 of Phase 237 shipped clean (2/3 plans); 237-03 unblocked; v30.0 roadmap coverage 26/26 requirements, zero orphans)_

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-04-19T01:51:18Z (Phase 237 Wave 2 — Plan 02 INV-02 classification committed in `f142adaf`; 237-03 pending)

## Deferred Items

Carried forward from v29.0 close (2026-04-18):

| Category | Item | Status | Reason |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| quick_task | 260327-n7h-run-full-test-suite-and-analyze-results- | missing | False-positive in audit tracker — task is complete (PLAN.md + 260327-n7h-SUMMARY.md exist); audit tool looks for `SUMMARY.md` but actual file is prefix-named. Pre-dates v29.0 milestone; out of audit scope. |
| quick_task | 260327-q8y-test-boon-changes | missing | False-positive in audit tracker — task is complete (PLAN.md + 260327-q8y-SUMMARY.md exist); same prefix-naming mismatch. Pre-dates v29.0 milestone; out of audit scope. |

# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-20 after v30.0 milestone close)

**Core value:** Every finding a C4A warden could submit is identified and either fixed or documented as known before the audit begins.
**Current focus:** No active milestone. v30.0 shipped 2026-04-20 — run `/gsd-new-milestone` to define the next one.

## Current Position

**Milestone:** none — awaiting `/gsd-new-milestone`
**Last shipped:** v30.0 — Full Fresh-Eyes VRF Consumer Determinism Audit (closed 2026-04-20 at HEAD `7ab515fe`; tag `v30.0`)
**Last activity:** 2026-04-20

## Accumulated Context

Decisions and completed milestones logged in `.planning/PROJECT.md`.
Detailed milestone retrospectives in `.planning/RETROSPECTIVE.md` (v30.0 section most recent).
Archived milestone artifacts:

- v30.0: `.planning/milestones/v30.0-ROADMAP.md`, `v30.0-REQUIREMENTS.md`, `v30.0-phases/`
- v29.0: `.planning/milestones/v29.0-ROADMAP.md`, `v29.0-REQUIREMENTS.md`, `v29.0-phases/`
- Earlier: `.planning/milestones/` (v2.1 onward)

Audit deliverables:

- `audit/FINDINGS-v30.0.md` (729 lines, 10 sections; 17 INFO / 31-row regression PASS / 0 KI promotions)
- `audit/FINDINGS-v29.0.md`, `audit/FINDINGS-v28.0.md`, `audit/FINDINGS-v27.0.md`, `audit/FINDINGS-v25.0.md` (prior milestones)
- `audit/v30-*.md` — 16 upstream Phase 237-241 proof artifacts (byte-identical since Phase 242 plan-start `7add576d`)

## Global Project State

- Contract tree at HEAD (post-v30.0): byte-identical to v29.0 `1646d5af`; baseline `7ab515fe` locked
- READ-only audit pattern carried forward from v28.0/v29.0 — any next milestone that re-opens `contracts/` or `test/` writes must explicitly lift the READ-only gate
- KNOWN-ISSUES.md: 4 accepted RNG-determinism exceptions (affiliate roll / prevrandao fallback / F-29-04 mid-cycle substitution / EntropyLib XOR-shift) — all re-verified at HEAD `7ab515fe` in v30.0 Phase 241

# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-18)

**Core value:** Every finding a C4A warden could submit is identified and either fixed or documented as known before the audit begins.
**Current focus:** v30.0 Full Fresh-Eyes VRF Consumer Determinism Audit — prove every VRF-consuming function in `contracts/` is completely deterministic from the moment of RNG request (backward + forward freeze), with only the four documented KNOWN-ISSUES exceptions accepted.

## Current Position

**Milestone:** v30.0 — Full Fresh-Eyes VRF Consumer Determinism Audit
**Phase:** 237 (VRF Consumer Inventory & Call Graph) — ready to start
**Plan:** —
**Status:** Roadmap ready — 6 phases (237-242), 26/26 requirements mapped, awaiting Phase 237 plan creation
**Last activity:** 2026-04-18 — Roadmap authored via `/gsd-new-milestone` roadmapper step

**Audit baseline:** HEAD `7ab515fe` (contract tree identical to v29.0 `1646d5af`; all post-v29 commits are docs-only)
**Write policy:** READ-only — no `contracts/` / `test/` edits (carry forward v28/v29 cross-repo READ-only pattern). Writes confined to `.planning/`, `audit/`, and possibly `KNOWN-ISSUES.md` (for FIND-03 promotions).
**Deliverable target:** `audit/FINDINGS-v30.0.md`

**Accepted RNG exceptions (out of scope for re-litigation — documented in KNOWN-ISSUES.md):**

1. Non-VRF entropy for affiliate winner roll (deterministic seed, gas optimization)
2. Gameover prevrandao fallback — `_getHistoricalRngFallback` after 14-day VRF outage
3. Gameover RNG substitution for mid-cycle write-buffer tickets (F-29-04 invariant disclosure)
4. EntropyLib XOR-shift PRNG — VRF-seeded, known theoretical non-uniformity

## Phase Structure (6 phases, 237-242)

| Phase | Name | Requirements | Depends On |
|-------|------|--------------|------------|
| 237 | VRF Consumer Inventory & Call Graph | INV-01, INV-02, INV-03 | — |
| 238 | Backward & Forward Freeze Proofs | BWD-01..03, FWD-01..03 | 237 |
| 239 | rngLocked Invariant & Permissionless Sweep | RNG-01, RNG-02, RNG-03 | 237 |
| 240 | Gameover Jackpot Safety | GO-01..05 | 237 |
| 241 | Exception Closure | EXC-01..04 | 237 |
| 242 | Regression + Findings Consolidation | REG-01, REG-02, FIND-01..03 | 238, 239, 240, 241 |

**Execution order:** 237 first. After 237 completes, 238/239/240/241 can execute in parallel. 242 requires all four.

## Accumulated Context

Decisions logged in `.planning/PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table.
Detailed milestone retrospective in `.planning/RETROSPECTIVE.md` "Milestone: v29.0".
Full v29.0 phase artifacts in `.planning/milestones/v29.0-phases/`.

Prior RNG-related milestone artifacts worth referencing during v30.0 planning (but NOT relied upon — this is fresh-eyes):

- v25.0 RNG fresh-eyes sweep (Phases 213-217)
- v29.0 Phase 235 Plans 03-04 (per-consumer backward-trace + commitment-window enumeration)
- v29.0 Phase 235 Plan 05 (TRNX-01 rngLocked invariant 4-path re-proof)
- v3.7 VRF Path Test Coverage (Phases 63-67 Foundry invariants + Halmos proofs)
- v3.8 VRF commitment window audit (Phases 68-72)

### Pending Todos

_(none — Phase 237 plan creation is the next action)_

### Blockers/Concerns

_(none — v29.0 shipped clean; v30.0 roadmap coverage 26/26 requirements, zero orphans)_

## Deferred Items

Carried forward from v29.0 close (2026-04-18):

| Category | Item | Status | Reason |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| quick_task | 260327-n7h-run-full-test-suite-and-analyze-results- | missing | False-positive in audit tracker — task is complete (PLAN.md + 260327-n7h-SUMMARY.md exist); audit tool looks for `SUMMARY.md` but actual file is prefix-named. Pre-dates v29.0 milestone; out of audit scope. |
| quick_task | 260327-q8y-test-boon-changes | missing | False-positive in audit tracker — task is complete (PLAN.md + 260327-q8y-SUMMARY.md exist); same prefix-naming mismatch. Pre-dates v29.0 milestone; out of audit scope. |

# Known Issues

Pre-disclosure for audit wardens. If you find something listed here, it's already known.

## Intentional Design (Not Bugs)

**stETH rounding strengthens invariant.** 1-2 wei per transfer retained by contract, pushing `balance >= claimablePool` further into safety. Not a leak.

**Non-VRF entropy for affiliate winner roll.** Deterministic seed (gas optimization). Worst case: player times purchases to direct affiliate credit to a different affiliate. No protocol value extraction.

## Design Mechanics

These are architectural decisions, not vulnerabilities.

**VRF swap governance.** Emergency VRF coordinator rotation requires a 20h+ stall and sDGNRS community approval with time-decaying threshold. Execution requires approve weight > reject weight and meeting the threshold -- reject voters holding more sDGNRS than approvers block the proposal. This is the intended trust model.

**Chainlink VRF V2.5 dependency.** Sole randomness source. If VRF goes down, the game stalls but no funds are lost. Upon governance-gated coordinator swap, gap day RNG words are backfilled via keccak256(vrfWord, gapDay) and orphaned lootbox indices receive fallback words. Coinflips and lootboxes resolve naturally after backfill. Independent recovery paths: governance-based coordinator rotation (20h+ stall threshold) and 120-day inactivity timeout.

**Lido stETH dependency.** Prize pool growth depends on staking yield. If yield goes to zero, positive-sum margin disappears. Protocol remains solvent -- the solvency invariant does not depend on yield.

**Gameover prevrandao fallback.** `_getHistoricalRngFallback` uses `block.prevrandao` as supplementary entropy when VRF is unavailable at game over. A block proposer can bias prevrandao (1-bit manipulation on binary outcomes). Edge-of-edge case: gameover + VRF dead 3+ days. 5 committed VRF words provide bulk entropy.
